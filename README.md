# Overview
Just a library of my solutions for leetcode problems as I start to work on them, separated by programming language into different directories. If I come up with a new solution I'll likely just add it to the corresponding problem file.

# Improvements to add
- Add elegent way to run code ( currently you have to manually create a way to get it to work )
- Add comments identifying Runtime of each solution and Memory usage according to what leetcode says ( Maybe even add my own implementation of it ðŸ‘€)
